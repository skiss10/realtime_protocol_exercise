1) Figure out how you want to simulate a disconnection 

- Create a prompt for user input when running client.py asking if the user wants to simulate a disconnection. If yes, then for how long (in seconds)
- Update client.py server_handler or message_handler to have logic that if discconect simulation is True, disconnect for that time (this will be just socket.disconnect, time.sleep. socket.reconnect) async somewhere here..
- Update client.py to format a reconnection type message and logic to send 
- Update server.py to handling incoming reconnection type requets (rejecting any older than 120 seconds)
-


2) Add a way for server.py to gracefully handle client disconnects and stop heartbeats / thread gracefully

6) Add a variable to constants.py to simulate various connection types (SSE vs. Socket. vs. gRPC)
