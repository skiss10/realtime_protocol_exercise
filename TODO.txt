TODO Future:

- Implement a checksum ack from the client to the server to indicate that the server is ready to end that connection

- Expand on testing. Look into using magic mock or decoupling functions in server.py and client.py from the connection object input paramter

- Update proxy.py and server.py to gracefully handle server failures

- Add a variable to constants.py to choose from one of various connection types (SSE vs. raw socket. vs. gRPC)

- implement load balancer for incoming requests (behind proxy) that load balances incoming requests with hash ring

- implement redis session store with multiple servers (use multiprocessing with servers)
