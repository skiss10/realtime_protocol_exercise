TODO Future:

- update web sequence to include checksum ack

- Expand on testing. Look into using magic mock or decoupling functions in server.py and client.py from the connection object input paramter

- Update proxy.py and server.py to gracefully handle server failures so that I can eventually implement load balancer for incoming requests (behind proxy) that load balances incoming requests with hash ring

- implement redis session store with multiple servers (use multiprocessing with servers)

- Add a variable to constants.py to choose from one of various connection types (SSE vs. raw socket. vs. gRPC)
