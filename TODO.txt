TODO

- figure out testing

- add a README 

- put older files into an archive directory with an explaination in readme why they're there

- add info about requirements.txt to README

- reference TODO in readme


Future:

- Run multiple servers and load balance incoming requests (will need to update testingproxy.py and testingserver.py to handle server failures)

- Add a variable to constants.py to choose from one of various connection types (SSE vs. raw socket. vs. gRPC)

Items to monitor:

- figure out why the client wasn't recieving the first message despite it being sent by the server
